Mario-Kart-Stream-Analyzer  comes with a completely intact uni.txt
id.py and id/ are inlcuded encase you want to expand upon uni.txt

To generate a new uni.py:
Place images of the respective rank in id/${num}
when id.py is run with '-regen' as arg1 it will generate id/${num}html
((e.g 1html, 2html/))
which will be jp2a--compiled version of the images provided

id.py will then print out the 'perfect' or the 'only consistent'
version of the rank. 1 being the area it scans, and 0 being the ones it ignores.

For instructions for best results, read comemnts in  #id.py
