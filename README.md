# This project was made, when I was first learning Software Development. 
It was made, for me, and me alone, and was not user friendly. Its purpose and scope was limited.

It is currently maintained on gitlab, and will not be merged downstream, here.

This is a user friendly github project, and I am archiving this project to help it perform in SEO for when you look up terms related to Mario Kart and Data.

It was made unrelated to me, and is beautiful. Any practical use you would have for my software, would be better served there.
